# Make / Model

[Athletics](http://athleticsnyc.com) created Make/Model as an environment for building prototypes.

As the web has changed, our process for designing websites has changed. Necessitated by the responsive nature of todayâ€™s web, we strive to get out of PSDs and into the browser as early in the process as possible. This allows us to build for the constraints of the multi-device web early in our design process.

Make/Model is written in PHP using the [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) microframework and the [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templating engine.

## Installation

### Composer

Install Make/Model using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

An example `composer.json` would look like:

```json
{
	"repositories": [
		{
			"type": "vcs",
			"url": "https://github.com/athletics/make-model"
		}
	],
	"require": {
		"athletics/make-model": "dev-master"
	},
	"minimum-stability": "dev"
}
```

Then you can run `composer install`.

## Content Sources

Make/Model integrates with third-party APIs to use as sources for content. This removes the work of setting up representative content, passing it off to a CMS, and allowing for the reuse of content across projects.

Currently Squarespace is the only supported datasource, but several others are in the works. Pull requests for new datasources are welcome.

### Supported

- Squarespace - Squarespace features simple authentication and [a JSON endpoint for every URL](http://blog.squarespace.com/blog/your-data-everywhere).

### Upcoming

- [WordPress.com REST API](http://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/) - Access data from WordPress.com blogs, uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication, also available in the [Jetpack for WordPress plugin](http://jetpack.me/).
- [WP-API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API) - Native WordPress JSON API, on the WordPress 4.1 roadmap to be integrated into WordPress core.

For more information on how the WordPress.com REST API and WP-API differ, [see the WP-API documentation](http://wp-api.org/misc/comparison.html).
