# Make / Model

Athletics created Make/Model as an environment for building prototypes. 

As the web has changed, our process for designing websites has changed. Necessitated by the responsive nature of todayâ€™s web, we strive to get out of PSDs and into the browser as early in the process as possible. This allows us to build for the constraints of the multi-device web early in our design process.

Make/Model is written in PHP using the [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) microframework and the [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templating engine. It uses [Squarespace](http://blog.squarespace.com/blog/your-data-everywhere) as a datasource, which features a JSON endpoint for every URL.

## Installation 

### Composer

Install Make/Model using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). 

An example `composer.json` would look like:

```json
{
	"repositories": [

		}
	],
	"require": {
		"athletics/make-model": "dev-master"
	},
	"minimum-stability": "dev"
}
```
